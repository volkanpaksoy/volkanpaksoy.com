		<p>I never cared for building a media centre before as I’m front of my desktop computer all day long and it has everything I need! But I was always curious about what the whole thing is about. As I was already looking for an excuse to buy myself one of those <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Raspberry Pi B+ models</a> it didn’t take too long before I decided to build a shiny little media centre for myself!</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>First of all before I engaged with this world they’ve already changed the name of the software! What’s formerly known as XBMC is now called Kodi. It has releases for Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc. so no wonder why it’s so ubiquitous. For Raspberry Pi there are two popular distros: <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspbmc</a> and <a href="http://openelec.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpeElec</a>. When you are a complete noob choosing the right distro might be a hassle. After a quick search I found a a nice comparison <a href="http://www.htpcbeginner.com/raspbmc-vs-openelec-comparison-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Turns out Raspbmc comes with a full OS and running XBMC on top of it. That’s why I decided to go with it as it would give me full control over the Raspberry Pi and I could use it for other purposes as well.</p>

<p>I mentioned the Raspberry Pi already but I needed a few accessories too.</p>

<p>£0 doesn’t, unfortunately, mean they were free. It just means I used my existing gadgets lying around idly so it’s a win-win situation anyway. It felt good to utilize them even though that meant spending extra 60 quids!</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Alright, now that we know what to install and where to install, let’s get cracking! Installation is dead simple as with all Raspberry Pi projects. All we have to do is download the latest build from <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspbmc website</a> and prepare an SD card using a tool like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Win32 Disk Imager</a>. Insert it into the Pi and you’re good to go. When you plug in the pi and connect to your monitor/TV you get to the home screen:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/11/XBMC-Home.png" alt="XBMC Home screen"></p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>So it’s almost ready to kick back and enjoy podcasts, TV shows and movies but we need to tweak it a little first.</p>

<h4 id="wireless">Wireless</h4>
<p>If you can use wired network, do so as it would be much faster. Unfortunately I have to use a wireless adaptor because of the location of my switch and me not wanting a long Ethernet cable crossing the room! To switch to Wi-Fi go to Program –&gt; Raspbmc Settings. In the Network Configuration tab change  Network Mode to “Wireless (WIFI) Network”</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/11/XBMC-Network-Settings.jpg" alt="XBMC Network Settings"></p>

<h4 id="audio">Audio</h4>
<p>For audio I use my speakers and wireless headset which are both connected via 3.5mm audio jack. The default audio output is HDMI so I needed to change it to Analogue in System –&gt; System Settings –&gt; System –&gt; Audio Output</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/11/XBMC-Audio-Settings.png" alt="XBMC Audio Settings"></p>

<h4 id="stuff-to-watch">Stuff to watch!</h4>
<p>Almost there! Now we need to add stuff. To add an online source just hover Videos and select “Add ons”. Then you can install scripts for your favourite video/audio sources. My all-time favourite podcast network is
<a href="http://twit.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWiT</a> so I was relieved to see there was an add-on for it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/11/XBMC-Video-AddOn.png" alt="XBMC Video AddOn"></p>

<p>Also it is possible to add RSS feeds manually as explained in <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/add-podcast-feeds-xbmc-media-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> nice article.</p>

<h3 id="whats-missing">What’s Missing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I added sources from my desktop computer for TV shows and movies but ideally they should be put on a NAS on the network so it doesn’t rely on desktop up and running all the time (even though it is!)</li>
  <li>To enjoy it fully it would be nice to plug it to a nice big TV. An 18.5” monitor is barely good enough for video podcasts but definitely not a viable option to watch movies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It feels nice to watch my favourite podcast shows on a cheap, remote-controlled small computer. It was absolutely hassle free to build it which left more time to play with fun stuff, like installing a Twitter add-on (which unfortunately failed to run because of incompatibility issues!) I’ll definitely keep on playing with it. After adding more stuff and streamlining the process (like adding new favourite feeds to a playlist automatically) I’m sure I’ll enjoy it a lot more.</p>

		<p>One of the sites I like is Coderwall. It’s a nice place to check out quick tips from different developers. Also it has a voting system which you feel a bit validated when people find your tips helpful. I have 6 “protips” in their site and some of them had a few upvotes. I was motivated to post more tips which are especially too short for a blog post.</p>

<h2 id="your-upvotes-are-no-good-here">Your upvotes are no good here!</h2>
<p>A few backs I logged in to check if I had any new upvotes. To my surprise, not only I didn’t get anything new, all my previous hard-earned upvotes were deleted as well! I contacted their support and 2 weeks later they said they could have been deleted because of spam concerns. If a tip is online for about a year and it was viewed by hundreds of people and got 3-4 upvotes in the process I think it’s safe to think that there’s not a scam going on here. Even if you think something is fishy you should give them benefit of the doubt just because the numbers are very small and very plausible. Luckily, I have better things to do than scam Coderwall and a few measly upvotes have no meaning at all.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-pack-and-leave">Time to pack and leave</h2>
<p>A week later I decided to publish all my posts n my blog. I went to my account to list my tips but the link wasn’t working. So I couldn’t even get the tips I had created. At least they provide a way to search by username. That’s how I could find my own tips. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back! So the lesson learned here is that always take control of your own content. Publish it on your own site/blog or whatever platform you control then propagate your content elsewhere if you choose to do so.</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-coderwall">Goodbye, Coderwall!</h2>
<p>I know this idea sounds very natural and obvious to some people. I think I should have thought of it before this incident but at least I recovered my content without any loss and learned a valuable lesson. I may still post to Coderwall but after deleting my votes and treating me like a scammer I’ve lost interest to their site. Looking at the quality of their support I don’t think they will be around for a long time anyway!</p>

<p>From now on I will post suck quick tips on this blog under “Tip of the Day” category.</p>

		<p>In some cases you may want objects in a bucket be deleted automatically, for example for log files or surveillance footage you may want to keep only latest n days. You can run scripts to delete them manually but it can also be done by setting the expiration date on the bucket.</p>
