		<p>I have a number of electronics kits and boards like Netduino, Arduino and Gadgeteer. Among all the cheapest one I’ve ever seen is Texas Instrument’s MSP430 LaunchPad. Last year I bough one of these just because it was so cheap but couldn’t spend much time on it. I recently found out it has dropped to £8 and I decided to buy the latest version. Now that I have 2 of these babies I definitely need to spend some time to play with them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/MSP430_02.jpg" alt="MSP 430"></p>

<p>Looks like there are a few differences between the two. The one on the left in the picture above is the old version. The new version comes with better controllers and male pins on the side.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>First thing to do is go to its official site and download Code Composer Studio to develop programs to run on it. It is an Eclipse-based IDE so I’m hoping it won’t take to long to get acquainted with it.</p>

<h4 id="first-program">First Program</h4>
<p>Good thing there are plenty of tutorials about it. I decided to follow one of the simplest ones which just blinks one of the on-board LEDs. To be honest, the code looks hideous:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>unsigned int i = 0; 
void main(void)
{
  WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;     
  P1DIR |= 0x01;

  for (;;)
  {
    P1OUT ^= 0x01;
    for(i=0; i&amp;lt; 20000; i++);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I deleted the comments to keep it short. But even with detailed comments it looks hard to develop complex applications with this. Anyway, I’ll see how far I can get with it. So far, for this amound of work, the results are not so bad:</p>

		<p>After Raspberry Pi opened the way for low-cost small computers, a number of them started to show up in the market. One of the most recent ones gaining ground is BeagleBoard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/beagle_logo_hdr.gif" alt="Beagle Logo"></p>

<p>I just bought the cheap version which is called BeagleBone black which looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/BeagleBone_Black_Board.jpg" alt="BeagleBone_Black_Board"></p>

<p>Nice looking little fellow, right?</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>I followed the getting started guide which you can find on the home page. Also the link in the resources section. When I plugged it in to USB it is recognized as a removable device. Then downloaded and tried to install the drivers as suggested but no luck. Apparently the drivers are unsigned and Windows 8 didn’t allow me to install them. Googling a little bit I found a step-by-step guide to change the machine settings so that unsigned drivers can be installed. I followed the steps and it worked like a charm. The original URL is in the resources section also the steps are below.</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To be able to install drivers on Windows 8 follow the steps below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Press win+c on the keyboard to bring up the charms side bar (or move mouse to right top corner of the screen)
2. Click the Settings button.
3. Click the Change PC Settings at the bottom of the sidebar.
4. On screen that shows up, select the General option from the sidebar then scroll down the page that appears.
5. Click the Restart now button under the Advanced startup section.
6. You will momentarily see the restarting screen, then it will switch to a blue screen titled "Choose an option"
7. Click the Troubleshoot button.
8. Click Advanced options.
9. Click Startup Settings
10. Click Restart
11. You should then see a Startup Settings screen after your computer reboots.
12. Press 7 or F7 on your keyboard to Disable driver signature enforcement
13. Now Windows 8 will continue starting up.
14. Log-in as normal, and then run BONE_D64.exe again
15. Now you should see 4 warning dialogs about "unsigned driver installation", click OK for all of them.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>So far so good:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/BeagleBone_Black.jpg" alt="BeagleBone Black"></p>

<p>I can connect to the web server running by default. I’ll try to explore what I can do with it further. Let’s see what it is capable of.</p>

<p>EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) is a free utility that helps prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities and is designed to prevent hackers from gaining access to a system.
I haven’t used it before but according to the documentation the new features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Certificate Trust:</strong> Allows to detect Man in the Middle attacks that leverage fraudulent SSL certificates</li>
  <li>
<strong>ROP mitigations:</strong> Block exploit that leverage the Return Oriented Programming exploitation technique.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Early Warning Program:</strong> Allows enterprise customers and Microsoft to analyze the details of an attack and respond effectively.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Audit Mode:</strong> Provides monitoring functionalities for testing purposes.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Redesigned User Interface:</strong> Streamlines the configuration operations and provides accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the hood this tool performs very low-level operations and honestly I don’t know what they all mean. For me the biggest benefit was learning about advanced attacks and exploits and how to avoid them. I strongly recommend reading the user’s guide. Apparently there are many interesting attack techniques when it comes to exploiting the memory. EMET provides mitigation methods against these attacks. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP):</strong> This mitigation was shipped with Windows Vista SP1 but with EMET it can be used in previous versions as well.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Data Execution Prevention (DEP):</strong> This mitigation exists since Windows XP but applications need to be compiled with a special flag to opt-in to DEP. With EMET allows applications without that flag to opt as well.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Heapspray allocation:</strong> “When an exploit runs, it often cannot be sure of the address where its shellcode resides and must guess when taking control of the instruction pointer. To increase the odds of success, most exploits now use heapspray techniques to place copies of their shellcode at as many memory locations as possible.”</li>
  <li>
<strong>Mandatory Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):</strong> ASLR randomizes the address space of the loaded modules so that attackers cannot predict their locations. Like in DEP, EMET allows applications without the special flag to use this feature.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/EMT_Scr.png" alt="EMET"></p>

<h3 id="certificate-trust">Certificate Trust</h3>
<p>I was wondering about this feature as it’s more “visible” than the others. Basically what you do is define protected websites and pinning rules. Pinning Rule is essentially importing an SSL certificate’s thumbprint. Once you import it you create a protected website which is simply entering the domain name of the site and you associate the certificate with the site.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/EMET_CertTrustConfig.png" alt="EMET"></p>

<p>From now on if the certificate changes EMET displays a message like below:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/07/EMET_SSL.png" alt="EMET"></p>

<p>Actually, I didn’t want to spend a great deal to test it first so the easiest way to test is running Fiddler (allow it to install it’s own certificate) and visit login.live.com. EMET comes with that site already configured so as soon as it notices the certificate doesn’t match its rule it fires the alarm.
Looks like a nice feature but it only works with IE which I almost never use other than testing my code. Also I was expecting more fuss about it actually. It just displays the window for a few seconds and you can keep visiting the site. If for instance you were looking at something else in that brief period while the site is loading you may completely miss the fact you are being “Man-in-the-Middle”d.
Overall, it’s better to have it than not having it at all I think.</p>
