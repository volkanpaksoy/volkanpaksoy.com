		<p>VMWare is one of my favourite IT companies. They are specialized in one area and they create very nice products. And they mind their own business. I mean you don’t read about them in patent dispute related news. As virtualization is the key technology behind cloud computing in a way VMWare is one of the pioneers to make it happen. They say Microsoft is advancing with HyperV 3.0 but currently I’ll stick to VMWare Workstation for now. As of version 8.0 VMWare Workstation comes with a cool feature called VM Sharing. As the name implies, you can sharing a whole machine and connect to it from another workstation application and manage that machine as if it was a local machine. So if you need to access a virtual machine from multiple computers you can accomplish it without creating multiple copies of the machine. All you have to do is open the VM you want to share and select <strong>VM -–&gt; Manage –-&gt; Share</strong>. Keep in mind that the machine must be powered off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/SharedVM00.png" alt="VMWare"></p>

<p>Sharing wizard is very simple. It asks if you want to clone the machine and move it under the shared VM folder. I like moving it because I don’t want to deal with multiple copies. Then from the client side select <strong>File –-&gt; Connect to server</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/SharedVM01.png" alt="VMWare"></p>

<p>Then provide the hostname / IP address along with administrator credentials and you can see the shared VMs under (not surprisingly) <strong>Shared VMs</strong> menu at the bottom of the left menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/SharedVM02.png" alt="VMWare"></p>

<p>The rest is exactly the same as the regular process. You can manage the remote virtual machine as if it resides in your local environment.</p>

		<p>AWS must be short for awesome! I love using it. It makes managing virtual machines so much easier yet provides full power to the user through its API. Thanks to vision of Jeff Bezos, every function you see on the management console can be accessed via API as well. Back in 2002 Jeff Bezos mandated that all teams will expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. This approach make complete sense. It makes separation of layers much more easier, makes the code testable. That’s why I’m currently big on <em>ServiceStack</em> and <em>WebAPI</em> but that’s a discussion for another post. In this post I’d like to share some of the tips &amp; tricks that I picked during my involvement with AWS. Of course, as many IT related things, this is an ongoing process and I may post sequel to this one in the future. Currently my tips are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>TIP 01: Always create production servers with termination protection on</strong>
If there is one thing I don’t like about AWS is that in the management console there is no way of separating the production and test/staging machines. So first use a clear naming convention to distinguish them but sometimes that’s not enough. In the heat of the moment you can attempt to stop or terminate a production instance. If you don’t have termination protection enabled this attempt would become a tragedy but if you have it on simply nothing happens and you get to keep your job. If you forgot to turn it on while creating an instance you can always change it by right-clicking on the instance and selecting Change Termination Protection.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/AWS_Termination_Protection.png" alt="AWS Termination Protection"></p>

<p><strong>TIP 02: You can change instance type in a few minutes</strong>
One of my favourite features is that you can stop the instance and change it’s type. This way you can upgrade or downgrade a machine within minutes. So don’t worry if you are not sure what instance size you would need for a specific job. Just ballpark it, observe and upgrade/downgrade at an idle time.</p>

<p><strong>TIP 03: Use auto-scaling</strong>
This feature is not available via management console but it’s possible with API. You can write your application but it’s even easier by using command line developer tools. Basically you create a scaling policy for scaling up and one for scaling down. You define the alarm conditions and when these conditions are met the policy you specify is executed. This way if your web servers are under heavy load, for example, you can automatically launch another machine. They all have to be under the same load balancer of course. You can find more about auto-scaling here: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/</a></p>

<p><strong>TIP 04: Use Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment</strong>
Regions have several availability zones in them. Although you cannot create cross-datacentre systems, you can create instances using different AZs. So  if one data centre goes down other instances can still be responsive. It’s the simple principle of not putting all the eggs in the same basket.</p>

<p><strong>TIP 05: Customize management console</strong>
AWS management console comes with a cool feature: It enables you to pin your favourite services on top of the page for easy access. There are a bunch of them but most likely you’ll need EC2 and S3 available at all times. At least I do. You can pin them by simply dragging the service name and dropping it onto the top bar. After pinning them on top, they are always one click away.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/AWS_Customize_Menu.png" alt="AWS Customize Menu"></p>

<p><strong>TIP 06: Change disk size while creating the image</strong>
This is especially handy for Windows instances as they demand more space than Linux ones. The default size for a Windows Server is 35GB. It’s actually quite enough for a standard Windows installation but I guess Amazon is reserving some of the space for some reason because when you launch the machine you only get around 3GB free disk space which to me sounds terrifying. If a log file gets out of hand a little bit it can bring down the whole machine. So it’s best to get some free space upfront. At least for the peace of mind if nothing else.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/AWS_Change_Disk_Size_01.png" alt="AWS Change Disk Size"></p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/AWS_Change_Disk_Size_02.png" alt="AWS Change Disk Size"></p>

<p><strong>TIP 07: Don’t forget to delete manually attached EBS volumes</strong>
When you terminate an instance make sure you delete all the attached EBS volumes that are not set to auto-delete. The default volume that comes with the instance has Delete on termination option checked in the wizard so they are automatically cleaned up. But if you create a volume manually and attach it to an instance there is no option to set this flag. So you have to delete them manually. AWS is kind enough to warn you to delete them when deleting the instance. If you don’t take care of them immediately and you have auto-scaling you may end up with terminating lots of instances that leaves unused disks that you keep paying for.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/AWS_Delete_Instance.png" alt="AWS Delete Instance"></p>

<p><strong>TIP 08: Reserve as early as you can</strong>
This is another budget tip. If you are certain about the size of an instance then buy a reserved instance for that type. Reserved instance is not a technical concept. When you buy one you start paying less by the hour for an instance of that type.

		<p>It’s been a while since I’ve started using StyleCop in my projects. Last year I managed to sneak it in to my company’s projects as well. Applying it to existing projects and fixing all the errors was a tiring process at first but I believe it was worth it. It really helps for consistency. Regardless of the developer of a certain block of code it’s very easy to read it because everybody has to adhere to same rules across the company. Here are a few tips to manage this:</p>

<p><strong>01. Force StyleCop warnings to be treated as errors.</strong>
I hate warnings completely actually. That’s why I set treat warnings as errors to All on the projects I work on. This helps to eliminate many potential bugs
before they become an issue.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2012/11/TreatWarningsAsErrors.png" alt="Treat warnings as errors"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, StyleCop errors are not included in this. But with a little tweak we can turn on this feature for StyleCop warnings as well. Just add the following line to your project’s .csproj file inside the first PropertyGroup tag:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;stylecoptreaterrorsaswarnings&gt;false&lt;/stylecoptreaterrorsaswarnings&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The wording is the opposite of Visual Studio’s (treat errors as warnings instead of the other way around) so we have to set this to false.
After reloading the project, you won’t be able to successfully build your project without fixing all the StyleCop rule violations (which is a good thing!)</p>

<p><strong>02. Integrate StyleCop to MSBuild</strong>
Naturally if the process is not automatic it won’t work. If, as a developer, it’s left to me to right-click on the project and run StyleCop manually I’d forget it after a few times. The easiest way to integrate it with MSBuild is adding StyleCop.MSBuild NuGet package to your project. Alternatively if you have installed full StyleCop application you have StyleCop.Targets file under your installation directory. By adding that file to the project you can achieve MSBuild integration.</p>
<blockquote>
  <import project="R:\StyleCop.BuildTarget\StyleCop.Targets"></import>

</blockquote>

<p>For multiple developer environment it’s best to use a fixed path so that when someone new starts working on the project they can still build the project. To accomplish that, we mapped R drive to a folder that contains the targets file so that the build doesn’t break. Of course needless to say new developers have to do the mapping to make this work.</p>

<p><strong>03. Run StyleCop on the server as well</strong>
The problem with manually enabling treating warnings as errors feature on the developer system is that it can be easily forgotten or can be temporarily disabled for some reason. When the developer forgets to re-enable it,he/she can check-in code that violates code convention rules. To avoid that we should reject code on the source control during the check-in process.This is where StyleCopSVN comes in. Of course as the name implies this solution works only for SVN. I haven’t yet looked into other source control systems like Git or TFS for this feature yet.
You can get SVNStyleCop here: <a href="http://svnstylecop.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://svnstylecop.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>The way it works is quite simple and the official page has a good tutorial about it. Mainly you override the pre-commit hook and run StyleCop from before the code is submitted. The problem with this is that you have to maintain a separate copy of rules and StyleCop files so when you update your rules you have to remember to update it on the server as well.</p>

<p><strong>04. Use symbolic links to maintain one global rule set</strong>
Windows Vista (and above) comes with a handy utility called <em>mklink</em>. By entering the following command you can create a symbolic link to Settings.StyleCop file anywhere you please.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>mklink /H Settings.StyleCop {Path for the actual file}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way all projects are going use the same settings file. The problem is it’s a tad cumbersome especially if your project involves lots of projects.</p>

<p><strong>05. A better approach for one rule set to rule them all</strong>
I was pondering for minimizing user efforts to deploy StyleCop and it hit me! Our beloved NuGet could take care of it as well. StyleCop has already a package in the official NuGet repository but the problem with it is that it comes with its own StyleCop rule file so it’s not quite suitable for a team environment. Even not for a single developer because all projects will have different rules and it can quickly become a maintenance nightmare. The idea of using NuGet is creating a package that contains StyleCop rules and libraries. When the package is installed it copies the libraries, rules and targets file under the project. Also an install script can be used to add the import project and treat warnings as errors settings mentioned in tips 1 &amp; 2. The advantages of this method are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All projects installing the package will be using the same rule set downloaded from server</li>
  <li>MSBuild integration is done automatically</li>
  <li>Treat warnings as errors update is done automatically</li>
  <li>No configuration needed (i.e: Mapping drives, creating symbolic links etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage is if rules are updated the package needs to be re-installed for he projects.
It’s still not perfect but compared to other methods I think it’s a neat way of distributing and enforcing StyleCop rules.</p>
