<p>I bought this about 2 months ago. I wore it every single day since then and I just loved it! It is basically a motion sensor that detects and keeps track of your daily movements. You can set your own daily goals steps you walked, distance you took or calories you burnt.</p>

<p>I can keep track of distance by using my Garmin ForeRunner 10 (which I reviewed <a href="https://volkanpaksoy.com/archive/2013/07/20/run-to-the-hills-run-for-your-life/">here</a>) but this one is easier to use because it does everything in the background. Garmin takes a few minutes to start because it needs to find your GPS coordinates but that’s not the case for Flex.</p>

<p>Flex lets you keep track of distance, active minutes, calories and steps.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/03/FitbitGoals.png" alt="Fitbit Goals"></p>

<p>Also you can log your weight, other exercises and food intake so that you can calculate the net calories throughout a time period.</p>

<p>Another great feature about it is tracking your sleep quality. You can use this data in conjunction with your daily activities.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/03/FitbitSleep.png" alt="Fitbit Sleep"></p>

<p>And here is my favourite feature: Alarm! It turns out if something on your wrist start to vibrate you wake up. Instantly! Of course I keep my phone’s alarm still running as a fallback method but this one works pretty good.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I bought it for £68 and as of now it is listed as £83 on Amazon. Apparently the price fluctuates a bit but I think £70 – 80 price range is good for this product. I charge once every 3 days or so. Other than that I completely forget about it while it does its job in the background. It motivates you to reach your goals and be more active in general and the silent alarm is absolutely fantastic. I’d recommend this to anyone who would like to have more exercise.</p>

		<h3 id="framework-design-guidelines">Framework Design Guidelines</h3>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2014/01/Framework_Design_Guidelines_Cover.jpg" alt="Fitbit Flex"></p>

<p>Having a common framework is quite important to reduce code reuse. But designing that framework properly and consistently is a huge challenge. Even though we are living in a RESTful world now, I think having a framework or a set of common libraries for personal or commercial projects is still relevant. A well-designed well-tested framework would significantly improve any application built on top of it.</p>

<p>I had referred to this book partially before but this time decided to read it from cover to cover and make sure I “digest” all. It contains countless gems that every developer should know. Anyone developing even small libraries can benefit from this book a lot. You don’t need to design the .NET framework (like the authors). Also it comes with a DVD full of presentations of authors.</p>

<h3 id="companion-dvd">Companion DVD</h3>
<p>Unfortunately I lost my DVD. Probably it’s inside one of the many CD cake boxes. I was hoping to check it out as I went along the book. But luckily I found out that it is freely available from the publisher. Check you the download link in the resources section. One thing to beware about the download is that you can come across another link in the Brad Abrams’s blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2009/04/01/framework-design-guidelines-book-extra-content-from-the-dvd-posted.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The download works fine but one of the presentations inside it is corrupted so I suggest you download each section separately from the site in the resources.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes">Some notes</h3>
<p>The book is full of gems and very useful tips. Here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep it simple: “You can always add, you cannot ever remove”</li>
  <li>There is no perfect design: You always have to make some sacrifices and consider the trade-offs</li>
  <li>Well-designed frameworks are consistent</li>
  <li>Scenario-driven design: Imagine scenarios to visualize the real-world use of the API When in doubt leave the feature out, add it later. Conduct usability studies to get developers’ opinions</li>
  <li>Keep type initialization as simple as possible. It lowers the barrier of entry.</li>
  <li>Throw exceptions to communicate the proper usage of API. It makes the API self-documenting and supports the learning-by-doing approach.</li>
  <li>Going overboard with abstractions may deteriorate the performance and usability of the framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though it’s been a few years since this books was released it is still a very helpful resource.</p>

		<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/common/aws/AmazonS3.png" alt="Amazon S3"></p>

<p>I have two AWS accounts and I made a mistake by using mixing the usage of services. More specifically, I hosted an application on one account but used S3 on the other. So I perpetually had to switch back and forth between accounts to access all services I used. First I thought fixing it would be a non-issue but it proved to be a rather daunting task.</p>

<h3 id="bucket-naming-in-s3">Bucket naming in S3</h3>
<p>In S3, all buckets must have unique names. You cannot use a name if it’s already taken (much like domain names). Since I was using the bucket already, creating the same bucket in the other account and copying its contents was not an option. The second idea was to create the target bucket with a temporary name, copy the contents, delete the first one and rename the target bucket. Well, guess what? You cannot rename a bucket either! Another problem is when you delete a bucket you can create a new one with the same name right away. I’m guessing this is because of the redundancy S3 provides. It takes time to propagate the operation to all the nodes. My tests showed that I could re-create the bucket in the other account only after 45 – 50 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="to-develop-or-not-to-develop">To develop or not to develop</h3>
<p>My initial instinct was to develop a tool to handle this operation but I decided to check out the what’s already available. I was occasionally using Cloudberry but wanted to check its competitors hoping one of the tools would support the functionality I need.</p>

<h4 id="cloudberry-explorer-for-amazon-s3">Cloudberry Explorer for Amazon S3</h4>
<p>I find this tool quite handy. It has lots of functions and a nice intuitive. It comes in flavours: Free and Pro version. I used free version so far and unless you are a big enterprise it seems sufficient. It allows you to manage multiple AWS account. It allows copying objects among accounts but not moving a bucket (actually after my findings above I wasn’t very hopeful anyway)</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/12/AmazonS3_CloudBerry_Main.png" alt="AmazonS3 CloudBerry Main"></p>

<p>As you can see in the menu bar, it supports lots of features.</p>

<h4 id="s3-browser">S3 Browser</h4>
<p>This one comes with a free version too as well as a paid version. The free version is limited to 2 accounts and you can only see one account at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/12/S3Browser.png" alt="S3 Browser"></p>

<p>I tried to copy a file and paste to another but it got an Access Denied error. I could do the same thing with Cloudberry in seconds by simply dragging and dropping to the target folder.</p>

<h4 id="bucket-explorer">Bucket Explorer</h4>
<p>Third candidate only has a 30-day trial version as opposed to a free one. The second I installed it I knew it was a loser for me because it doesn’t support multiple accounts. Also as you can see below the UI is hideous so this is not a tool for me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/12/BucketExplorer.png" alt="Bucket explorer"></p>

<h3 id="and-the-winner-is">..and the winner is</h3>
<p>Cloudberry won by a landslide! It looks much more superior than both of the other tools combined.</p>

<h3 id="operation-bucket-migration">Operation Bucket Migration</h3>
<p>So I backed up everything locally and deleted the source bucket so that I could create the same one in the new account. After periodically checking for 45 minutes I finally created the bucket and uploaded the files. Set the permissions and the operation was completed without any casualties.. Well, at least I thought that was the case..</p>

<h3 id="nobody-is-perfect">Nobody is perfect!</h3>
<p>After I uploaded the images I reloaded my blog. The first image re-appeared and I was ready for the celebrations which were abruptly interrupted by the missing images in the second post. The images were nowhere to be found locally in none of the two backups I took. I think Cloudberry has a bug when handling filenames with hyphens. I’m still not certain that is the case but that’s the only characteristic that differs from the other files. Anyway, the moral of the story is triple-check everything before you’re initiating a destructive process and don’t trust external tools blindly.</p>
