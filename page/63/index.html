		<p>There aren’t too many reasons why someone would like to make their own Ethernet cables. Sheer fun, learning the nitty-gritty (and useless in most cases) details of how they are made are to name a few. Also as I have too many gadgets making my own cables at any length I please would be convenient and can save a few bucks in the long run. So let’s get started.</p>

<h3 id="the-toolkit">The toolkit</h3>

<h4 id="cable">Cable:</h4>

<p><strong>CAT6:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002SQPDXS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002SQPDXS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00</a></p>

<p><strong>CAT5:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000HWY304/ref=wms_ohs_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000HWY304/ref=wms_ohs_product</a></p>

<p>For the obvious reasons! It’s best to get the latest version generally. I will use CAT6 all around my network but I also bought CAT5e as I was anticipating some errors at the beginning so I’d better make them by wasting cheaper cable.</p>

<h4 id="rj45-modular-connectors">RJ45 Modular Connectors:</h4>

<p><a title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004HTK30M/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004HTK30M/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004HTK30M/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00</a></p>

<p>I’ve watched a lot of tutorial videos. When an expert is showing it, it looks quite easy but I quickly found out it’s not. Aligning all 8 cables and placing them in the correct order is not as easy as it seems. So I definitely recommend two-piece crimps that come with a “guide”. It’s a small piece that allows you to insert all the cables relatively easily and then you insert the whole block into the crimp.</p>

<p><strong>RJ45 Crimp Tool:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004J02DRU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004J02DRU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00</a></p>

<p>The set I bought comes with a crimper and a cutter. It looks good enough to do tis job and quite cheap. After the cables are inserted in the connector, the crimper is used to press them all in and connect with the</p>

<h4 id="tester">Tester:</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007CJUEDA/ref=wms_ohs_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007CJUEDA/ref=wms_ohs_product</a></p>

<p>Altough it is easy to test the cable by connecting to a machine, it is generally recommended to use a tester. I guess it makes sense especially when you have to make lots of cables. I bought one for £4 so I guess it’s good deal. The downside is doesn’t support CAT6 which I didn’t notice at the or ordering. If manual testing doesn’t prove to be helpful I would consider buying a better product.</p>

<h4 id="boots">Boots:</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009EPCOP6/ref=wms_ohs_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009EPCOP6/ref=wms_ohs_product</a></p>

<p>These are plastic sleeves over the connector. They are helpful sometimes to avoid the connector clip from getting broken</p>

<h4 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h4>

<p><strong>CAT5 vs. CAT5e vs. CAT6:</strong> The difference is that CAT6 supports 1000Base-T/1000Base-TX (Gigabit Ethernet). CAT5 and CAT5e supports 10Base-T/100Base-TX (Maximum 100Mbit/s)  CAT5e is an improvement over CAT5. It introduces new crosstalk specifications. (Crosstalk means a signal creating a detrimental effect on another channel)</p>

<p><strong>T568A vs. T568B:</strong> The order of the cables matters and they have to be in the same order in both ends. These specific orders are named as T568A and B. What I understand you can use as long as you use it for both ends but all resources I’ve found favoured using T568B so I’ll use that one as well.</p>

<p><strong>Crossover cable:</strong> When you connect one end in T568A and the other T568B it becomes a crossover cable (Regular ones are called patch cables). Crossover cables are used to connect two computers instead connecting a computer to a switch or router. I’ll test creating one of these as well.</p>

<h4 id="action">Action!</h4>

<p>I think we have everything ready to get started. Here’s what I did step-by-step:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut the required length of cable.</li>
  <li>Remove the outer jacket.</li>
  <li>Arrange the wires by referring to the wiring standard (T568B) and insert them into the guide of the connector.</li>
  <li>Insert the guide into the connector.</li>
  <li>Insert the connector to the crimp tool and press it firmly.</li>
  <li>Repeat Steps 1- 5 for the other end.
10 minutes later I had my first homebrew CAT5 cable:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Cat5Final.jpg" alt="CAT5"></p>

<p>Let’s use the tester to verify we did good. Using the tester is quite simple: Just plug in the both ends to the device. If you lights blinking from 1 to 8 simultaneously on both sides that means we are good. I tested it with a broken table too. In that case no lights were on so it’s easy to see if it works or not.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/CableTester.jpg" alt="Cable Tester"></p>

<p>CAT6 is slightly different: It has plastic part in the middle of the cable which holds the cables apart as shown in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Cat6.jpg" alt="CAT6"></p>

<p>All we have to do cut that piece before separating the pairs and the rest is exactly the same as CAT5.</p>

		<p>In this post we are diving into coding and developing a small application using the beer sample database that ships with Couchbase 2.0.</p>

<h2 id="environment-setup">Environment Setup</h2>
<p>To develop a .NET application with a Couchbase backend, we need the Couchbase .NET SDK. The current version as of this writing can be downloaded from <a href="http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/net/1.2/Couchbase-Net-Client-1.2.1.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. But the best way to get it using Nuget. Using the SDK is fairly simple. It comes with a main class called *CouchbaseClient. *All operations are performed using this class.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-server">Connecting to server</h2>
<p>The first step is connecting to the server and the easiest way to do is using the configuration file.</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">configuration</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">configsections</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">section</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">"couchbase"</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">"Couchbase.Configuration.CouchbaseClientSection, Couchbase"</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">configsections</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">couchbase</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">servers</span> <span class="n">bucket</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">"beer-sample"</span> <span class="n">bucketpassword</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">""</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
            <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">add</span> <span class="n">uri</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">"http://192.168.1.111:8091/pools/"</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>

            <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">add</span> <span class="n">uri</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">"http://192.168.1.112:8091/pools/"</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">servers</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">couchbase</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">configuration</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see from the configuration section, if you have multiple nodes in the cluster just add their URIs to the servers list. Once IPs and the bucket and the password are specified we are done. We don’t need to explicitly connect to the database, we can just create a new client instance and start calling methods</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CouchbaseClient</span> <span class="n">client</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">CouchbaseClient</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// DB operations go here</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="basic-operations">Basic Operations</h2>
<p>OK so far so good. We are connected to the server without a hassle. As there is already data in the server let’s get some sample data from the database.
As the database is a key/value store we can add any type of data we want to. We can create our JSON objects in a string and insert/update data with it. But most likely we want to use our domain objects instead of manipulating raw JSON. There are 2 things to consider here. Once we tackle those issues the rest is quite easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mark your objects as <em>Serializable</em>: This is required to persist any object. Once you make the class serializable you can run CRUD operations on it.</li>
  <li>The default serializer is binary serializer. That means when you store an object using by calling Store method you will get something like this when you try to view the object:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Beer_Binary.png" alt="Beer Binary"></p>

<p>This is not too helpful. We cannot read and index. So we’d rather store it in JSON format. Luckily StoreJson method comes to rescue. The following code produces the result below which is exactly what we wanted. To map the key’s in JSON object to the properties in our class we use JsonProperty attribute in the Newtonsoft.Json library which is used the SDK itself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Beer_JSON_Code.png" alt="Beer JSON Code"></p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Beer_JSON_Output.png" alt="Beer JSON Output"></p>

<p>Store and StoreJson methods accept an argument of type StoreMode. The values of StoreMode are Add, Set and Replace. <em>Add</em> is used to create a new record (INSERT), Replace is used to update an existing record (UPDATE). Set adds the record if it doesn’t exist and updates it if it exists (MERGE – but simpler).
To delete an object we call the Remove method with the objects key as argument.
So basically we perform CRUD operations with Get/GetJson, Store/StoreJson and Remove methods.</p>

<h2 id="querying-database-with-views">Querying database with views</h2>
<p>Views in Couchbase 2.0 are functions written in JavaScript that use a technique called Map/Reduce. Map/Reduce is a complex topic that I have not fully covered yet but basically it’s a method for processing large data sets in a distributed environment. It is developed by Google. It involves 2 functions called map and reduce. The map function filters entries for certain information and can extract information. The result of a map function is an ordered list of key/value pairs called an <em>index</em>. The results of map functions are stored in disk by the Couchbase server. Reduce function is optional and can be used to perform sum, aggregate or similar calculations on the output of map function.
Views can be grouped in <em>design document</em>s which can be associated with a bucket. I consider them as namespaces. Couchbase Server offers two kinds of views: Development and Production. As creating a view means creating an index. it may incur some overhead on the performance of the system. So development views are handy to fully test before publishing to production environment. Also production views cannot be edited via admin console which forces the developer to develop and test the view in development environment first.
So to demonstrate what they look like let’s examine the view that returns all the breweries.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/01/Beer_View_MapFunc.png" alt="Beer_View_MapFunc"></p>

<p>We have 2 types of objects in the database (beer and brewery). This function only emits the objects that are of type brewery.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>So all this theory means nothing if we don’t put it into good use. You can get source code of the sample application (I call it Beer Explorer) from my Github account. Also if you want to see what it looks like before diving into the code I host a live version here: <a href="http://beerexplorer.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://beerexplorer.me</a>. Feel free to play with it.</p>

		<p>In this post, I’ll talk about some technical details and terminology of Couchbase. The official documentation is very comprehensive and I highly recommend taking a look at it: <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.couchbase.com/docs/</a></p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>First of all I recommend you check the supported OS list <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-getting-started-prepare-platforms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I tried to install it on Windows 8 but turns out it’s not supported yet. Then I installed it on Windows Server 2008 R2 and a Ubuntu Server 12.10. You can find Linux installation instructions <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is quite easy. There are a few things that need to paid attention though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>File locations: Actually this step is very easy, just accept the default location. But Couchbase recommends storing document and index data on different disks to get the best performance,</li>
  <li>Memory Size: First node in the cluster determines the quota and that value is inherited to the following nodes. To update it, on the management console, select Data Buckets and click on the arrow on the left of the bucket name. Then by clicking on Edit you can change this value.</li>
  <li>Bucket Type: memcached and Couchbase bucket types are significantly different so you have to choose carefully. memcached buckets don’t support persistence nor replication. They are meant to be an in-memory caching solution.</li>
  <li>Bucket Name: During setup you cannot change the name of the default bucket. Couchbase recommends to use it for testing purposes only. So it’s best to create your own bucket  for the actual data once the installation is over.</li>
  <li>Flush: This is a very dangerous operation. It allows you delete all the data in a bucket. Default is disabled and I’d recommend to keep it that way.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A couch database is called a <em>bucket</em>.</li>
  <li>A <em>document</em> is a self-contained piece of data. It is a JSON object. A row in a RDBMS would be stored in a document with all the data it’s related to. (i.e: A customer record may contain a list of orders). This approach is called Single-Document approach and the document is called an <em>aggregate</em>. More about it in Modeling Documents section later in this post. A new feature that came with v2.0 is these records can be indexed and queried.</li>
  <li>
<em>vBucket</em> is short for “Virtual Bucket” and they work functionally equivalent to database shards in traditional relational databases. Good news is that Couchbase will automatically manage vBuckets.</li>
  <li>
<em>XDCR</em> stands for Cross Data Center Replication. It’s a very cool feature that can be used in a multiple of scenarios such as spreading data geographically or creating an active offsite backup.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modelling-documents-has-many-vs-belongs-to">Modelling Documents: <em>has-many</em> vs. <em>belongs-to</em>
</h2>
<p>The way we model data should depend on the structure and nature of the data. There are two approaches when modelling the data.
has-many means storing all the child records with the parent. For example a standard Customer – Order relation could be expressed like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">"id"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">123</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Valued</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"surname"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Customer"</span>
    <span class="s">"orders"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="s">"order1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"order2"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"order3"</span> <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"order1"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"orderDate"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"2012-12-20"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"sent"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Customer stores the IDs of the orders. This method can be problematic if the parent (Customer in this example) is updated frequently. As orders can be accessed via customer this will effect the overall query performance.
belongs-to approach suggests approaching it from the other direction. If we modeled the above example with belongs-to approach we would come up with something like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">"id"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">123</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Valued</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"surname"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Customer"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"order1"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"orderDate"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"2012-12-20"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"sent"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s">"customerId"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">123</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"order2"</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>This is preferable to avoid contention. With this method we need to use indexing to be able query all orders by customerId. has-many approach performs better because a multiple-retrieve query is faster than indexing and querying.</p>

<h2 id="backup-and-restore">Backup and Restore</h2>
<p>Before diving into playing with the data it’s always a good practice to backup the original data. Couchbase provides 2 options to accomplish these tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Good ol’ file copy
Copy the data files stored under the default path (which is <em>“C:\Program Files\couchbase\server\var\lib\couchbase\data”</em> for Windows). The disadvantage of this method is that it can only be restored to offline nodes in an identical cluster environment. Also database is not compressed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cbbackup / cbrestore
These tools can be found in the bin folder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think a slight disadvantage is that you have to specify password in clear text in the command line. I was expecting just providing –p parameter would end up it asking me the password after I enter the command. Instead I got an error saying the password cannot be empty.</p>

<p>Advantages are that it allows a backup to be restored onto a different size and configuration. Also it compresses the data so it’s disk-space friendly.</p>

<p>Tip: When specifying the backup path to cbrestore make sure to remove the trailing backslash from the path.
  
In the next instalment of this series I’ll post a sample application using the Beer sample database that is shipped with Couchbase 2.0</p>
