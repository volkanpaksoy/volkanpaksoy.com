		<p>I used to wonder what different key sizes meant when dealing with SSL. Also, I noticed that SSL certificate I had purchased said “128/256 bit encryption” in its feature list which only made me more confused. What does it actually mean and why should it use 128-bit if it supports 256 anyway? I checked the website that’s running on a Linux machine and saw that it used 256-bit encryption whereas another website of mine was running with 128-bit encryption. And I bought both certificates from the same vendor so it has to do something with the server.</p>

<h3 id="whats-with-the-naming">What’s with the naming?</h3>
<p>For the uninitiated, TLS is the new name for the protocol. SSL name was discontinued after version 3 and after that TLS 1.0 was released. As of this writing the latest version is TLS 1.2 which was released in 2008. So technically the name of the protocol is Transport Layer Security (TLS) but many people, including me, still refer to it as SSL.</p>

<h3 id="key-sizes">Key Sizes</h3>
<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/SSL_Key_Sizes_01.png" alt="SSL Key Sizes"></p>

<p>Basically the key size (2048 bit in the image) is the public/private key pair size. This size is determined when CSR is created for the certificate. This is what determines how vulnerable the key is to brute-force attacks. Currently 2048-bit is considered to be very strong.</p>

<p>128/256-bit is the length of the session key. A session key is generated during the handshake. A random data (of length 128 or 256 bit) is generated by the client and encrypted using the server’s public key. The server decrypts the message with its private key. Afterwards, server and client use this session key and use symmetric encryption. RSA keys are just used in the beginning of the communication.</p>

<h3 id="lets-see-it-in-action">Let’s see it in action</h3>
<p>I might have had a better understanding after the research but I still I had to resolve my issue. I needed to see 256-bit encryption. Since this is a rather sensitive operation I wanted to test it on a completely expandable machine. So I created two new small instances running Windows 2008 and Windows 2012. I quickly installed the IIS to both instances and checked what they looked like. As I suspected they were using 128-bit out of the box.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2008_Before.png" alt="SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2008_Before"></p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2012_Before.png" alt="SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2012_Before"></p>

<p>The problem is AES-256 option is not high in the list in the cipher suite that the server supports. This requires some registry update and group policy changes. Normally all these have to be done manually. You can find a resource below that explains how to do it (I haven’t tested it myself). Instead, I decided to use a tool which makes the whole process a lot easier and less error-prone. It’s called IISCrypto.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/IISCrypto2008.png" alt="IIS Crypto"></p>

<p>I just downloaded the tool and ran the best practices option. Restarted the server and here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2008_After.png" alt="SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2008_After"></p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2012_After.png" alt="SSL_Key_Sizes_Win2012_After"></p>

<p>Windows 2012 version prioritize TLS 1.2 over TLS 1.0 so it uses the newer version of the protocol even the browser I used was the same for both tests.</p>

		<p>**It’s been a while since I’ve started using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host my sites. I think it’s a great platform as you only pay for what you use and there are lots of options. And the best part is anything you can do via their user interface (and more) can be done programmatically via their API. I’m extremely happy using AWS but still I wanted to see what its competitors are doing.</p>

<h3 id="enter-rackspace">Enter RackSpace</h3>
<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/RackSpaceLogo.jpg" alt="RackSpace"></p>

<p>So I decided to test RackSpace first. One reason for selecting it is that it has a data centre in London (the closest AWS data centre to UK is in Dublin). Also it is based on <a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStack</a> platform which I wanted to play with for some time. I created my free account but it needs to be activated after you receive a call from a staff member. He just asked basic questions like my username and the reason I created the account. After the call the account was activated and I was ready to explore this new land.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/RackSpace_01.png" alt="Servers"></p>

<h3 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h3>
<p>This is still a work in progress actually, I cannot say I have fully covered everything about it. Here are just my first impressions and comparisons with AWS:</p>

<h4 id="pricing--billing">Pricing &amp; Billing</h4>
<p>Maybe I’m cheap but my first order of business was compare the prices! The cheapest Linux configuration starts from £0.030/hr. You can find the entire list <a href="http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud/servers/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. As the site I’m planning to migrate didn’t need much resources I decided to go with the cheapest one: 1GB RAM, 1vCPU, 20GB SSD. After the migration I’m quite happy with its performance.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I noticed is, unlike AWS, you pay for the machine even if you stop it. Excerpt from a documentation says “<em>Shutting down a server will <strong>NOT</strong> stop billing, since the virtual hard drives are persistent, server resources are always in use whether the servers is powered on or not.”</em>
Now that’s not cool! Actually if you are running web-based systems you never stop the machines anyway. But there are many times I preferred to keep the old machine stopped for a period until the new machine proves to functioning fully for example. It’s nice to have the chance to rollback easily if need be. Of course you can do it here too, but you just have to pay twice as much during that period.</p>

<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>When trying to configure the machine I noticed there isn’t a feature like Security Groups of AWS. I had to update the <em>iptables</em> configuration on the machine. Which would make it hard to manage firewall rules in a multi-machine environment. In AWS you just add the new machine to an existing security group and forget about it because all the existing rules are applied to the new one automatically.</p>

<h4 id="programmability-and-api">Programmability and API</h4>
<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/OpenStackLogo.jpg" alt="OpenStack"></p>

<p>Even though I haven’t developed anything for it yet, I just wanted to see what are our capabilities and how would I develop something when I needed. All I needed to do was get the NuGet package and I was ready to get the list of my machines in a a few minutes. Basically you can manage machines, images, volumes pretty much like AWS. I’ll put a pin to it for now and develop some tools for myself later.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpblogimg/2013/11/RackSpace_02.png" alt="Program"></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think the best thing about RackSpace is that it is built on top of OpenStack. This means if you your system to another vendor your applications using the API can remain intact. Also as it is open source software you can build your own data centre if you wanted to. Of course it sounds good to geek ears but I guess in real world it doesn’t have much value as such migration of systems are quite often. Other than that I didn’t see any advantages over AWS but I’ll keep the machine running for a while and see how it goes.</p>
